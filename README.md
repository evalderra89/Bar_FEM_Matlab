# Bar_FEM_Matlab
This code calculates the displacements, elements and nodal forces for a bar, using the finite element method.

To use this code, you need to create a folder called <<inputs>> and save the input files on it. You should modify the main function FEM_bar.m in the line 12 by typing the name of your input file. The Bar_FEM_Matlab folder contains two examples of input files (problem1.txt and problem2.txt). More information about the format of the input files is located in the function readFiles.m.
